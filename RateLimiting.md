Explain, in roughly one paragraph, how rate limiting works with Twitter's API: How can I understand my rate limit status? What happens if I exceed my rate limit?

Rate limiting with Twitter API’s defines the number of times within a given time period, you can access that particular end point or API. Twitter defines this time period as a 15 min window and different API end points have different Rate limit number. Rate limits is based on your access token, so Twitter has different rate limit values for access token generated by user and those created by application. App authorization has a better rate limit values in comparison to user authorization.

Rate limit status for an API call, can be determined by the HTTP headers and response codes.  The following values can be used to know the status
• X-Rate-Limit-Limit: the rate limit ceiling for that given request
• X-Rate-Limit-Remaining: the number of requests left for the 15 minute window
• X-Rate-Limit-Reset: the remaining window before the rate limit resets in UTC epoch seconds
In my application, I used the API endpoint GET application/rate_limit_status to know what is the status for my particular API call.
If we exceed the Rate Limit, the API does not return any value as expected. In my case, I got “null” values.  If an application abuses the rate limiting, then chances are more that the application or user will be blaclisted by Twitter and thus will not be allowed to access any API’s until the status is reverted back.
